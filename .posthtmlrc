Wright believes the increase in dining plan holders has resulted from an increased affection for Columbia’s dining hall food, the added security of COVID-19 quarantine meals, and an increase of students on specialty price meal plans due to food insecurity."

The University gave students another stipend for $15 that they could use at any time throughout the semester. Now, on-campus food trucks and modified dining hours are mitigating the lines.
